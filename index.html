            <li>
              Place the split bagels cut-side-up in a 6-quart air fryer. Cook at
              350 degrees F until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the bagels from the air fryer. Top each with 2 tablespoons
              tomato sauce, 1 slice of provolone, 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella,
              1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes if
              using. Add other optional toppings if using.
            </li>
            <li>
              Return the bagels to the air fryer. Cook at 350 degrees F until
              the bagels are well toasted and the cheese is melted and starts to
              brown in spots, 4 to 5 minutes more. Sprinkle with Parmesan and
              serve immediately.

            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>

            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>

            <li>
              Set air fryer to 325 F. Cut out a piece of parchment that just
              covers the bottom of the air fryer insert.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              Beat together both of the sugars and the butter in another bowl
              with an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed until light and
              fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrap down the bowl with a rubber
              spatula. Beat in the egg and then the vanilla. Reduce mixer speed
              to low, add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Stir
              in the chocolate chips with a wooden spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scoop out slightly heaping tablespoonfuls of dough and roll into
              balls. Working in batches (about 6 at a time), arrange them at
              least 1 inch apart on the parchment-lined insert. Air-fry until
              golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool in the insert for a couple
              minutes and then transfer with a spatula to a wire rack and cool
              completely. Cook the remaining dough balls in batches.

              Whisk together 1 tablespoon salt, 2 tablespoons pepper and 1
              teaspoon of the paprika in a large bowl until well combined. Add

            </li>
            <li>
              Preheat a 3.5-quart air fryer to 350 degrees F. Transfer the ribs

              brown, about 40 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meanwhile, combine the ketchup, cider vinegar, white vinegar,

              teaspoons pepper, 3/4 cup water and the remaining 2 teaspoons
              paprika in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring
              frequently, until the sugar is melted and the sauce is warmed
              through, about 2 minutes. Cover and keep warm over low heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the ribs are cooked, dip each one into the sauce, letting any

            <li>
              Stir together the panko, Parmesan, 2 teaspoons of the olive oil,
              the oregano, pinch of salt and a couple grinds of pepper in a
              shallow bowl or small baking dish until thoroughly combined. Pat
              the chicken dry between a couple paper towels, then sprinkle
              lightly with salt and pepper. Brush both sides of the chicken with
              1 1/2 tablespoons of the Dijon, then press into the panko-Parmesan
              mixture, making sure both sides are evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Toss the broccoli, remaining 2 teaspoons of the olive oil, a good
              pinch of salt and several grinds of pepper in a medium bowl until
              evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Preheat a 3.5-quart air fryer to 375 degrees F. Add the chicken to
              the air-fryer basket and cook until it’s starting to brown and
              crisp on the top, about 6 minutes. Flip the chicken over with
              tongs and position in the center of the basket, then scatter the
              broccoli around the perimeter. Continue air-frying until the
              chicken is crisp all over and an instant-read thermometer inserted
              in the middle registers 160 degrees F, and the broccoli is tender
              and charred, about 8 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meanwhile, stir together the yogurt, lemon zest and juice,
              remaining 1/4 teaspoon Dijon, a pinch of salt and several grinds
              of pepper in a small bowl. Serve alongside the chicken and
              broccoli for dipping.

              For the filling: Butter the sides and bottom of the insert of a
              6-quart slow cooker. Whisk together the cornstarch, lemon juice
              and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Add the mixture to the
              insert, add the berries and granulated sugar and toss.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the biscuit topping: Whisk together the flour, 2 tablespoons
              of the granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.
              Add the butter and rub the mixture together with your fingers so
              that it forms a coarse meal with some pea-sized lumps. Add the
              milk and stir with a wooden spoon to form a wet dough.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drop spoonfuls of the dough on top of the berry mixture. Combine
              the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and the cinnamon and
              sprinkle over the dough. Cover the slow cooker and set to high for
              3 to 4 hours. The cobbler should be bubbly and the biscuits should
              be cooked through. Let rest for 20 minutes before serving.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the sour cream topping: Meanwhile, combine the heavy cream,
              sour cream and confectioners' sugar in a medium bowl and beat with
              an electric mixture until the mixture forms medium peaks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spoon the cobbler into bowls and top with the whipped sour cream
              topping.

          <ul>
            <li>1 pound finely chopped white chocolate</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons nut or plain oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dried cranberries</li>
            <li>
              1 1/4 cups shelled pistachio nuts, toasted and papery coating

            <li>
              Tempering the chocolate for the bark requires a double boiler. If
              you don't have a double boiler, improvise one by using a saucepan
              and a stainless steel bowl: Nestle the bowl into the saucepan,
              allowing a few inches of space to remain between the bottom of the
              bowl and the bottom of the saucepan. Keep an extra bowl of a
              similar size on hand to transfer the chocolate for cooling. Rest
              the chocolate thermometer on a towel. Line a baking sheet with
              foil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour a couple inches of water into the bottom half of the double
              boiler and heat over medium-low to just below a simmer. Put the
              chocolate in the top half of the double boiler and set over the
              hot water. Slowly melt the chocolate, stirring with a
              heat-resistant rubber spatula. As the chocolate melts, check the
              temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 82 and 86
              degrees F. If it starts to rise above this temperature, quickly
              transfer the chocolate to the bowl on reserve and stir briskly to
              reduce heat. Return bowl to double boiler to maintain heat between
              82 and 86 degrees F.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove bowl from over the hot water just before all the chocolate
              melts. Stir vigorously until the chocolate melts completely. Check
              temperature again. Stir in the oil until evenly blended. Chocolate
              is now tempered and ready to use. Keep within the 82 to 86 degree
              F range, returning bowl briefly to the double boiler if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Quickly stir the fruit and nuts into the chocolate. Spread
              chocolate mixture out on the prepared baking sheet so it's about
              1/2-inch thick and the fruit and nuts are coated. Set bark aside
              at room temperature to harden. Break into angled pieces. Store in
              an airtight container at room temperature.
